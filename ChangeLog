        * ext/Makefile.am: Changes to reflect changes in ext/. Disabled
          rbgimpcolorspace.c.

          Gimp::CMYK classes.
          
        * ext/rbgimp.*: Minor formating changes. Removed init functions for
          removed/disabled modules.
          
        * ext/rbgimpconstants.c: Moved the line that defines the 
          Gimp::EnumNames module outside the loop. Removed the check for the
          "GIMP_" prefix. Added directory constants.
          
        * ext/rbgimpdialog.c: Removed the nothing() function. In
          handle_string_types() removed the 'data' variable and replaced it
          with NULL. Removed gettext() calls as it can now be called
          dynamically from Ruby.
          
        * Changed the way that rb_gimp_main() is used so that plugins that
          don't use an init or quit callback don't define empty callbacks.
          
        * ext/rub-fu-console.c: Added a gettext() call for the window name.
          Added some commenting and rearranged some code for readability. 
        
        * gimp-lib/rubyfu.rb: Menu items are now registered using
          RubyFu.menu_register(). Added some constants for common RubyFu
          menupaths. Minor readability changes.

          added support for nil values. Added Drawables to the
          Param#transform() method. Changed the marshal functions for
          Gimp::RGB to use #marshal_load() and #marshal_dump instead of the
          old marshaling methods. Minor reformatting.
          
        * gimp-lib/gimp_oo.rb: Added the ability to blacklist certain methods
          when creating classes to prevent deprecated procedures from becoming
          methods or to avoid name collisions.
          Removed GimpOO::ClassTemplate#add_constructor() as it's no longer
          needed. 
          
        * gimp-lib/gimp_oo_*.rb: Added method blacklists for deprecated
          methods.
          
        * gimp-lib/pdb.rb: Changed verbose mode to also display arguments to

        * gimp-lib/rubyfu.rb: Procedures with no menu now have their menu
          label defined as their procedure name. Changed return value
          validation to ignore accidental return values for procedures that
          return no values. Minor reformatting.
        
        * deleted plug-ins/rerunfile.rb.
        
        * plug-ins/runfile.rb: Added the ruby-fu-rerunfile procedure from
          rerunfile.rb.

          and shouldn't have been added in the first place.
          
        * plug-ins/Makefile.am: Removed helloworld.rb and rerunfile.rb.
        
        * plug-ins/*.rb: Added the GPL license to files that were missing it.

          Moved the call to open the dialog befor converting any parameter
          types. Added support for running a procedure with the last values.
          Added a call to bool2int_filter() so ruby-fu procedures can return
          booleans.
          
        * plug-ins/: Added new example plugins: gloom.rb, helloworld.rb,
          sunset.rb. Added runfile.rb/rerunfile.rb plugins to aid in plug-in

          functions.

        * Removed plug-ins/hello.rb.
        
        * plug-ins/Makefile.am: Removed plug-ins/hello.rb.
        
        * gimp-lib/gimp.rb: Changes in error handling to reflect
