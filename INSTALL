To install Gimp-Ruby you need to have GIMP 2.3 installed. Other than Ruby 1.8
and irb, Gimp-Ruby has no additional requirements that are not met by
installing GIMP 2.3. 

Assuming that provided an install prefix when building GIMP 2.3 to avoid
overwriting your 2.2 installation, you would do something like the following
to before building Gimp-Ruby.

  PREFIX=/your/gimp2.3/prefix
  PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig
  export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I $PREFIX"

  ./autogen.sh --prefix=$PREFIX
  
If you didn't provide an install prefix for GIMP 2.3, simply run:

  ./autogen.sh
  
Then to build Gimp-Ruby:

  make
  make install
