To install Gimp-Ruby you must have GIMP 2.3 installed. Other than Ruby v1.8
and irb v0.9.5, Gimp-Ruby has no additional requirements. 

Assuming that provided an install prefix when building GIMP 2.3 to avoid
overwriting your 2.2 installation, you would do something like the following
to before building Gimp-Ruby.

  PREFIX=/your/gimp2.3/prefix
  PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig
  export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I $PREFIX"

  ./autogen.sh --prefix=$PREFIX
  
If you didn't provide an install prefix for GIMP 2.3, simply run:

  ./autogen.sh
  
Then to build Gimp-Ruby:

  make
  make install
