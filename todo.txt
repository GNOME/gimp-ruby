Automatically supply RUN_NONINTERACTIVE to PDB procedures with a 'run-mode'
parameter. Adding it everytime is really annoying. With argument checking
you'd need to make a low level Gimp.run_procedure call to call a procedure
interactively anyway.

Make a blacklist of deprecated procedures that shouldn't be added as methods
to the objects types.

Make sure all the useful parts of the C API were wrapped. 

Weird crash occurs in the call test when testing the incoming arguments?

The color code has turned out to be sub-par, lots of room for improvment.

Figure out how the brush selection should really work.

Add a reset button to the interactive dialog.

Add more control to widget resizing for the dialog.

gettext support for dialogs.

Add autoconf checks for gettext support.
- Ruby gettext may be available as a gems package or a non-gems package.
  The check for gettext should not expect either method of its existance.

Test gettext and UTF-8 support.

Add check in build environment for irb.
- If irb doesn't exist, don't build ruby-fu-console.c or install console
  mode script.

Add extraction of translatable strings to build process.

Add an INSTALL file that explains the requirements and process to build and
install gimp-ruby.

Add a browse button to console mode.
- This may require creation of a PDB browser that can return the framework
  of a call to the selected PDB item in a Ruby compatible format.

Update plug-ins to use menu_register calls in addition to just register.
What menus should gimp-ruby register that are (or will be) used in plug-ins?
